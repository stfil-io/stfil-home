### STFIL- What you need to know

{{< collapse "What is STFIL?" >}}
STFIL is a liquid staking solution for FIL backed by industry-leading storage providers.  STFIL lets users stake their FIL - without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending.

STFIL attempts to solve the problems associated with initial FIL pledge - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked ETH liquid and allowing for participation with any amount of FIL to improve performance of the Filecoin network.

**Service Provided As:**
When staking with STFIL, users receive stFIL tokens which are issued 1:1 to their initial stake. stFIL balances can earn and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your FIL staking rewards, minus any penalties. Note that there are no lock-ups or minimum deposits when staking with STFIL.

When using STFIL, users receive staking rewards in real-time and they also could use stFIL tokens across the DeFi ecosystem to compound rewards.

{{< collapse "What is stFIL?" >}}
stFIL is a token that represents staked FIL in STFIL, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards - penalties.  stFIL tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed.  stFIL token balances are issued 1:1 to the FIL that is staked using STFIL.  stFIL token balances are updated when the oracle reports changes in total stake every day.

stFIL tokens can be used as one would use FIL, allowing you to earn FIL staking rewards whilst benefiting from, among other things, rewards across decentralised finance products.

{{< collapse "What is FDO?" >}}
FDO is a Filecoin token granting governance rights in the STFIL DAO.

FDO holders can participate in the STFIL DAO management liquid staking Agreement, determining key parameters (e.g., rates) to ensure efficiency and stability. By holding an FDO token, you gain voting rights in the STFIL DAO, as well as regular dividends from the STFIL platform.

### About others

{{< collapse "Is it safe to work with STFIL?" >}}
STFIL is a liquid staking solution and fits the next points:

- Open-sourcing & continuous review of all code.

- Committee of elected, best-in-class StorageProviders to minimise staking risk.

- Use of non-custodial staking service to eliminate counterparty risk.

- Use of DAO for governance decisions & to manage risk factors.

Usually when staking FIL you choose only one Storage Provider. In the case of STFIL you stake across many Storage Providers, minimising your staking risk.

{{< collapse "What are the risks of staking with STFIL?" >}}
There exist a number of potential risks when staking FIL using liquid staking protocols.

Smart contract security
There is an inherent risk that STFIL could contain a smart contract vulnerability or bug.    The STFIL code is open-sourced, audited and covered by an extensive bug bounty program to minimise this risk.    To mitigate smart contract risks, all of the core STFIL contracts are audited.    Audit reports can be found here.    Besides, STFIL is covered with a massive Immunefi bug bounty program.

stFIL price risk
Users risk an exchange price of stFIL which is lower than inherent value due to withdrawal restrictions on Lido, making arbitrage and risk-free market-making impossible.    The Lido DAO is driven to mitigate above risks and eliminate them entirely to the extent possible.    Despite this, they may still exist and, as such, it is our duty to communicate them.
